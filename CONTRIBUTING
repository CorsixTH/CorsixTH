HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

First Time
1. Ensure you have a GitHub account (https://github.com/signup/free)
2. Fork CorsixTH\CorsixTH (https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/fork)
3. Ensure you have a git client.  (http://windows.github.com or 
http://mac.github.com)
4. Clone your fork to your computer
	- If using github client, run Git Shell
	- git clone https://github.com/mygithubuser/CorsixTH.git
5. Add upstream remote
	- git remote add upstream https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH.git

Every Time
6. Sync with upstream
	- git fetch upstream
7. Create feature branch
	- git branch myfeature upstream/master
8. Checkout your feature branch
	- git checkout myfeature
9. Make your changes
10. Review your changes
	- git diff
	(each file) - git add
	- git commit
	Write an informative commit message and save
11. Push your changes to your fork
	- git push origin myfeature
12. Create a pull request 
(https://github.com/mygithubuser/CorsixTH/compare/CorsixTH:master...myfeature)

Now watch to see if your feature is accepted.

Notes:
Multiple commits:
If your feature is very big, break it into subprojects and do a separate commit 
for every independent operation.  This means doing step 10 several times as you 
go.  You still only need to do one pull request at the end.

Syncing with Upstream:
If it takes a long time between when you start your feature and when you finish 
there might be other important changes other people are making to CorsixTH.  It 
is a good idea to make sure your code will still operate correctly with the 
latest changes.  To do this:
	- git fetch upstream
	- git rebase upstream/master
What this does is downloads all the changes from CorsixTH\CorsixTH since you 
started, and pretends that all your changes were made after them.  If there are 
conflicts, for example if someone else changed the same line in the same file 
that you did you will be asked to resolve those conflicts.

If you follow these guidelines then you should be well on your way to producing 
good pull requests.

If you need more help just ask the friendly people on 
corsix-th-dev@googlegroups.com or via IRC in #corsix-th on freenode.
