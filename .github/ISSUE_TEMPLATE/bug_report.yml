        It is often useful for us if you have a save game from shortly before the issue occurs
        that can be used to recreate the problem. Sometimes a save that shows the issue happening
        may be useful as well.
        
        
        You can upload your save by putting it in zip file, then copy/pasting it directly into
        this text area. You can also click the "Attach files by dragging & dropping, selecting or
        pasting them" text at the bottom to upload the zip file.
        
        
        Alternatively, you can use an external source such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive and
        sharing the public link below to access your save game. The most important thing is to not
        remove these files after you upload them.
      value: "Save game attached to report: Yes/No"
