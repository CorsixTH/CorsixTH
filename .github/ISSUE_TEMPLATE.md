#### Save Game
*It is often useful for us if you have a save game from shortly before the
issue occurs that can be used to recreate the problem. Sometimes a save that
shows the issue happening may be useful as well. As GitHub currently only
supports uploading of images, you will have to upload your your savegames to
an another source such as [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com),
[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), or
[SkyDrive/OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com). Add the link to the file to
your issue and make the file(s) public, so we can access your gamelog or
savegame. The most important thing is to not remove these files after you
uploaded them!*
