  together just like the original game.
* In game map editor - A new map editor is available directly from the game
  menu.

  and this can affect your reputation.

  hospital's reputation (after a date set in the level file.)
* Machine smoke is now visible when machines are close to worn out.

Version 0.50 - released July 2015
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of changes in this update have been done under the hood.
Most of our third-party libraries have been updated, and especially Windows

  the Wiki for more information.

  since SDL 2 handles renderer itself.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.40 - released December 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has been a while since our last release, but good things come to those who wait!
Or... in this case it's contagious diseases. Watch out for epidemics on the
later levels in the campaign! Your patients are not as good as they used to be
either, so those who are not lucky enough to get vaccinated and cured might
get a visit from the Grim Reaper.
Also, don't forget to try out the new map St. Peter's near Cawley!

Happy gaming!


--- Gameplay ---

* Added: Epidemics. You can either choose to pay a fine to the authorities or
  try to cover up the epidemic by vaccinating and curing the contagious patients.
  Patients going between buildings will NOT trigger the alarm to the authorities.
* Added: The Grim Reaper. Previously patients have always gone to heaven when
  they die. No more! Sometimes they will instead fall down to the middle of the
  earth in a Lava Hole.
* Added: People with visual diseases will no longer arrive at the beginning of
  the level if that has been specified in the level file. Instead they arrive
  once a certain amount of months have passed.
* Added: If you refuse VIP visits a few times he can sometimes show up anyway.

* Change: Machine usage and explosions are now based on absolute number of uses.
  A machine that goes down to 0 will explode. Previously they were percentage based.

* Fix: The game would crash if you sacked a doctor in a room while a patient
  was using some equipment in that room.
* Fix: Sometimes the emergency bonus was not correctly calculated.
* Fix: Patients could die inside a room. They will now die outside the room
  unless they are just being cured.
* Fix: If winning the level at end of year the annual report would hide the
  winning fax.
* Fix: If there was no queue to a room a leaving staff member would not trigger
  a call for staff for the patient who had to abort their procedure in that room.
* Fix: If a handyman had pending tasks when he died in an exploding room the game
  could crash.
* Fix: A surgeon that is removed in mid-operation will now get properly replaced
  by a new one.
* Fix: If the GP room was built too early in the tutorial the game would crash
  when building a GP room later on if debug mode was turned off.
* Fix: Patients would try to enter an exploding room.  As you can imagine,
  this was bad.
* Fix: Psychiatrists would become shut-ins and just wander about their office
  forever.
* Fix: Patients leaving the queue to get a drink could be left to sit on a
  bench forever.


--- User Interface ---

* Added: Tooltips for the increase and decrease buttons in the research screen.
* Added: A sound that indicates if a screenshot was taken successfully.

* Fix: Staff raise description was hard to read in some languages
* Fix: The current language setting is translated and consistent with the
  options in the list.


--- Graphics ---

* Fix: Instead of turning into a Bloaty Head, Baldness patients will die
  with gracious hair.
* Fix: Patients will no longer fall through walls when dying.
* Fix: Dying Hairyitis patients should not lose their head when on the floor.


--- Hotkeys ---

* Added: 'Z' temporarily moves the game at maximum speed. Release to go back
  to the previous speed.
* Added: 'X' makes walls transparent until released.
* Added: Use the Numpad to change game speed.
* Added: Arrow key hotkeys in the staff management screen.
* Added: Press and hold on '+' and '-' when buying furniture to
  repeat the action.

* Change: Quick Save is now Shift+Alt+S, Quick Load is Shift+Alt+L.


--- Languages ---

* Change: "Plot" is used instead of "Parcel" to indicate where a handyman has
  been zoned to work in the Handyman staff dialog.

Most languages have been updated since our last release, but if you find that
your language has not, please help us to finish it!


--- CorsixTH Development ---

* Added: New flag for CMAKE: 'WITH_LUAJIT'. This way you can choose to use
  either LuaJIT or Lua5.1.
* Added: CMake toolchain for building with MinGW.
* Added: New debug menu option 'Run debug Script' that executes
  <install_directory>/Lua/debug_script.lua


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.30 - released November 2013
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release contains a whole new Level Editor, which means that in combination
with the already existing Map Editor whole levels can now be created a lot 
easier. Give it a try! We have also added many new options previously only
available by manually editing the config file to the options dialog.
Players will also notice that we have added an automatic update
check on game launch once we release the version after this one.
As usual there are of course also numerous minor tweaks here and there.



--- Gameplay ---

* Change: You can now build more than one desk in the ward. More nurses means
  a slightly faster throughput.
* Change: Patients would previously queue outside toilets even though there were
  free loos since it was dependent on number of people in the room. Now, as soon
  as a loo becomes free another patient enters the room to use it, 
  even if there is a long queue for the sink). 
  If there is a queue for the sinks there is a chance the patient will leave 
  without washing their hands - but will not be happy about doing this. 

* Added: The ability to control alien behaviour - sitting, knocking doors, 
  only to be available through emergency or arrive like all other patients.
* Added: Winning fax opens automatically and pauses the game.
* Added: Option to automatically accept wage increase requests when they "time out".
* Added: A new option allows for your average build content for each type of room 
  to be remembered, so will be added for each new room built later.  

* Fix: Doctors should get stuck less often, and handymen should not crash the
  game as frequently.
* Fix: It was not possible to replace a surgeon when a patient was in the room.
* Fix: Patients would sometimes get stuck inside a room when they should 
  have died.



--- User Interface ---

* Added: A new customization menu in the Options dialog. Most options from the
  configuration file are now available for change in-game.
* Added: A new directory menu in the Options dialog.
* Added: The game does now check for a more recent version of itself when
  launching.
* Added: A helpful message when the player puts more Researchers in the
  research department than there are desks.
* Added: The game now does a small integrity check on the Theme Hospital
  files to make sure that the most common corruptions are not present.
* Added: Confirm dialog to the quit/exit button on the main menu.

* Fix: The tooltip for the tutorial button was incorrect since the dialog
  has been visually changed.
* Fix: The announcer has had a few corrections made to his manuscripts.
  He is very happy about this!

* Removed: The settings menu is no longer available from within the game.



--- Hotkeys ---

Some hotkeys have been changed and/or added:

* Alt + A = Toggle Announcements
* Alt + M = Toggle Music
* Alt + S = Toggle Sound Effects
* Shift and + to zoom in five steps and Shift and - to zoom out five steps at a time.



--- Campaign levels ---

* Fix: An error in level 8 made it possible to win without meeting the
  reputation criterion.



--- Custom levels ---

* Change: For random emergencies each illness now has its own average number of
  patients to spawn. Previously they were all the same.

* Fix: Researching improvements was not really possible on some custom levels,
  i.e. if the map creator had made it so there were no machines at the start. 



--- Demo files ---

* Fix: When winning the demo level CorsixTH looked for another level to load,
  showing the wrong fax options and eventually crashing. 



--- Languages ---

* Added: Korean language.

* Fix: It was not possible to dump strings for a language with unicode 
  characters in the name.



--- Compiling ---

* Fix: You could not compile the game with WITH_AUDIO=0 if SDL_mixer was
  not present at all.
* Fix: WITH_AUDIO=OFF is now illegal in combination with WITH_MOVIES=ON.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.21 - released 2013-05-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is mainly a bugfix release, but a few minor features are still also
introduced, see the changelog below. 



--- Gameplay ---

* Fix: Staff would sometimes not go for a break.
* Fix: A few crashes related to Handymen.
* Fix: An error could occur if a fax message was removed just as it was animating
  into view.
* Fix: Patients could sometimes be told to go home multiple times,
  resulting in a crash.
* Fix: If a queueing patient was heading for a drinks machine just as the player
  moved that machine the game would crash.



--- User Interface ---

For a complete list, visit the issue tracker: 
http://code.google.com/p/corsix-th/issues/list



--- Gameplay ---

* Added: Radiators and other "edge tile" objects now occupy just one edge of 
  the tile, inline with the original game. As a result one tile corridors can
  now be heated properly. An addition is that you can place many such objects
  on a single tile as long as they face different directions.

* Added: Possibility to play movies in-game. At the moment the intro movie,
  advancement between levels and the win/lose movies has been added.

* Added: The atom analyzer can now be built in the research department if it
  is available on the map.

* Added: User actions are no longer allowed by default (for new games) when 
  the game is paused. When trying this it might seem like it doesn't work 
  correctly, but we try to mimic the original as much as possible. This for 
  example means that a staff member being placed as you pause will disappear 
  from the cursor. We might change this behaviour in the future though.

* Added: Some background sounds, coughs, phones ringing etc. 

* Change: Placing a member of staff inside a room that is already occupied
  will now replace that person.

* Fix: Earthquakes could be four times as severe as intended. Still todo:
  A tremor before a coming big earthquake.

* Fix: Crashes in certain situations involving receptionists and reception 
  desks.
* Fix: Patients being handled at a reception desk even if no receptionist 
  is present.
* Fix: Allow patients to be sent to the research room only if the corresponding
  room is not yet researched (so not if it is researched but not built).
* Fix: Don't cancel a place staff action just because the player happens to
  click on a door.
* Fix: The VIP would try to sit down if there was a queue for the reception desk.
  The VIP will no longer ever try to sit down, and he will have priority in
  the queue anyway.
* Fix: If a member of staff was done resting at the same time as he/she was
  also finished using the pool table or the video game another object in the
  room could get reserved indefinitely.



--- User Interface ---

* Added: You can now see in the bank statement which drug company a certain 
  drug was bought from. It has no effect on gameplay though.

* Added: The adviser now tells you why the research screen can't be opened
  before you have built a research department.

* Added: The Town Map functionality has been extended inline with Theme
  Hospital. For example, if you right-click somewhere in your hospital the
  view will be moved there.

* Added: Available options on open faxes now gets updated if for example a room
  explodes or the player builds a research department.

  same as in original TH but instead correspond to the order on the bottom panel.
* Added: Possibility to choose font file in the options dialog.
* Added: Player name is now customizable in the new game dialog.
 
* Removed: Keyboard shortcuts F8 and F9 for debug fax and debug patients.
* Change: Don't require debug mode to be able to dump the gamelog.
* Change: The shortcut for dumping strings is now Ctrl+T instead of Ctrl+Shift+D.

  and smaller. 
* Change: It is now possible to concentrate research on operating theatre
  diseases and redistribution of research is automatically done when
  a category has been completely researched.
* Change: Add disease name to patients' treatment history when they are 
  diagnosed.
* Change: Buttons on the bottom panel for fullscreen windows are now
  toggle buttons.
* Change: Reordered entries of graphs menu to correspond with order in
  bottom panel.

* Fix: Colour selection algorithm for freetype fonts resulted in unreadable text
  on faxes for some languages.
* Fix: When an unanswered fax became meaningless (e.g. if you built the 
  required room), it was only removed if its message button was visible at the
  bottom panel (not if it was queued because of 5 buttons being there already).
* Fix: Update the drug casebook if the last room of one kind explodes.
* Fix: The directory browser was not always shown if the chosen Theme Hospital
  install directory was illegal.
* Fix: Settings changed in the game will be saved immediately so that they
  persist to the next session regardless of how the game is shut down.
* Fix: The bottom panel is no longer always on top, making fullscreen
  dialogs truly fullscreen on 640x480.
* Fix: Don't play any announcements if there is no receptionist to do it.
* Fix: The adviser would not idle again if a new message arrived as he was
  idling from a previous message.
* Fix: While a player viewed the confirm dialog to delete a room he/she could
  continue to edit the room and complete it again resulting in an inconsistent
  game state.



--- Graphics ---

* Added: The graph dialog now actually displays graphs and statistics information.

* Added: It is now possible to choose among three colour scales for warmth
  level. Look in the top menu for this choice.

* Change: Screenshots get saved to a dedicated screenshot folder now, 
  which can be changed in the config.
* Fix: Loading a game on startup where a fullscreen window was open would
  open with the font messed up.
* Fix: Taking a screenshot (Ctrl+S) is now possible under windows without
  fiddling in a lua file.



--- Translations ---

* Added: The beginning of Brazilian Portuguese and Hungarian.
* Change: The "utf8" prefix has been obsolete for some time and has been
  removed from all language files.



--- When using Demo files ---

* Fix: The game would crash if the player tried to open the staff management 
  dialog by clicking on a staff portrait in the staff dialog.
