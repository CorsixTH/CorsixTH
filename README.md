## Getting Started ##

You will need the following:

- Grab the latest installer for your system:
   - Windows and macOS builds can be downloaded directly from [releases](https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/releases).
   - Linux and BSD repositories use either corsixth or corsix-th names [packaged versions](https://repology.org/metapackage/corsixth).
- We use graphics, sound and other data from the original game so one of the following is required:
   - Original game CD from eBay etc. or your dusty bookshelf:smile:
   - A download from [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/game/theme_hospital) or [Origin](https://www.origin.com/en-gb/store/buy/theme-hospital-origin/pc-download/base-game/standard-edition)

## Developers
### Coders and non-coders we want you!

We are always looking for help with improving CorsixTH. The code base is made up of Lua and C++. Most of the game logic is written in Lua, we love Lua and its approachable and easy to pick up nature, so hit fork and get started! But don't worry if you don't code as we can always use your help in other areas and if you have ideas for the project please contact us or open a new issue! We could also use help updating the documentation in the wiki and keeping the issue list up to date.


###### Features & Bugfixes ######
We still have features to add and bugs to fix, check out the issue tracker [here](https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/issues). Want to talk about adding a feature? post on our Google group or [contact us](#Contact).
