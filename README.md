CorsixTH
========

[CorsixTH] aims to re-implement the game engine of [Theme Hospital] and
to be able to load the original game data files. This means that you will
need a purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order
to use CorsixTH. After most of the original engine has been
re-implemented in open source code, the project will serve as a base from
which extensions and improvements to the original game can be made.

Getting started
---------------

See [Getting Started] for full details.

Briefly:

1. Ensure that you are using a supported platform (Windows, Linux, OS X)
2. Ensure that you have either the demo of Theme Hospital or the original
   game CD/files. The demo can be found at:
   <http://th.corsix.org/Demo.zip> and the full game can be found at
   <http://www.gog.com/gamecard/theme_hospital>. The full game can also
   often be found on eBay.
3. Copy the resources folder (which contains the folders "ANIMS" and "LEVELS"
   among others, this is in some cases called "HOSP") from either the demo
   or full game to a directory of your choice.
4. Build/install:
   * If you have downloaded a pre-compiled version:
     At this point Windows users should run the installer. During the
     installation you will be asked for the location of the original game
     files set in step 3. Linux and OS X users can simply run the game and
     set the location of the original game files when requested.
   * If you have a source code distribution, compile it:
     see [How To Compile] for full details. Start the game for the first
     time. You will be asked for the location of the Theme Hospital data
     files. Select the directory you chose in step 3.
5. Go play! If this doesn't go smoothly, then consult:
