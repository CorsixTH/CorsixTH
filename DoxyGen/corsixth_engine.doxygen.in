# Doxyfile 1.8.6

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "CorsixTH engine (the C++ part)"

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Open source implementation of Theme Hospital"

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is included in
# the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55 pixels
# and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy the logo
# to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = corsixth_engine

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to warning and progress messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. If QUIET is set to YES this implies that the
# messages are off.
# The default value is: NO.

QUIET                  = YES

# The WARNINGS tag can be used to turn on/off the warning messages that are
# generated to standard error ( stderr) by doxygen. If WARNINGS is set to YES
# this implies that the warnings are on.
#
# Tip: Turn warnings on while writing the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

WARNINGS               = YES

# If the WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED tag is set to YES, then doxygen will generate
# warnings for undocumented members. If EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES then this flag
# will automatically be disabled.
# The default value is: YES.

WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED   = YES

# If the WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate warnings for
# potential errors in the documentation, such as not documenting some parameters
# in a documented function, or documenting parameters that don't exist or using
# markup commands wrongly.
# The default value is: YES.

WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR      = YES

# This WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be enabled to get warnings for functions that
# are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters or return
# value. If set to NO doxygen will only warn about wrong or incomplete parameter
# documentation, but not about the absence of documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

WARN_NO_PARAMDOC       = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = "@CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/CorsixTH/Src" "@CMAKE_BINARY_DIR@/CorsixTH/Src"

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

RECURSIVE              = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each
# generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard
# footer. See HTML_HEADER for more information on how to generate a default
# footer and what special commands can be used inside the footer. See also
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the default footer
# that doxygen normally uses.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FOOTER            = "@CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/DoxyGen/new_footer.html"

# If the HTML_TIMESTAMP tag is set to YES then the footer of each generated HTML
# page will contain the date and time when the page was generated. Setting this
# to NO can help when comparing the output of multiple runs.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_TIMESTAMP         = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO
