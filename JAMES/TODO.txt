Change comments that pertain to keys that have been changed.
	Example: In menu part that says "Quit (Shift + Q)"

Finish comments in hotkeys.txt

Make other bottom_panel.lua panels available for hotkeys. I.E. build room, etc.

keypad enter doesn't seemt o work at all on anything.

Perhaps have window that tells us the current key mappings?
