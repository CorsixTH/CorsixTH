Do not change the old afterLoad items for this. You will need to add a new condition to the end and bump App SAVEGAME_VERSION
	bottom_panel.lua

-----------------------------------

Yeah, the afterLoad stuff is wrong. Basically in all cases now you want to remove all keymaps and set them all on load as well as initialization.
For each UI object with keymaps make a function to set keys and call it both at the end of afterLoad and in the constructor. Clear any mappings.

	I haven't yet pulled this down to give it a try to visualise the change, but these image_storePosition/recallPosition are a list alt and ctrl modifiers for, 0 through 9. The change as it stands can only alter the default modifiers and leaving the numerical string as the 2nd element. I don't have an alternate suggestion.

@TheCycoONE
	Fixing it's as easy as making a separate handler option for each. Should be done since the rest of the options expect / allow a table, and these ones can only be strings.

About:

game_ui.lua, 128:
self:addKeyHandler({self.app.hotkeys["ingame_storePosition"], tostring(i)}, self, self.setMapRecallPosition, i)

-----------------------------------

Can't you modify print_table to suit your uses instead of writing a whole new implementation?

utility.lua, 317:
function Table2String(table, recursive)

-----------------------------------
