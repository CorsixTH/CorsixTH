  <summary>Open source clone of Theme Hospital</summary>
  <description>
    <p>CorsixTH aims to reimplement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be
       able to load the original game data files. This means that you will need
       a purchased copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order to
       use CorsixTH. After most of the original engine has been reimplemented in
       open source code, the project will serve as a base from which extensions
       and improvements to the original game can be made.</p>
