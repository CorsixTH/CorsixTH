-- CorsixTH Beta 8 - 2011-09-24 ----------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CorsixTH aims to reimplement the game engine of Theme Hospital, and be able to
load the original game data files. This means that you will need a purchased
copy of Theme Hospital, or a copy of the demo, in order to use CorsixTH. After
most of the original engine has been reimplemented in open source code, the
project will serve as a base from which extensions and improvements to the
original game can be made.

-- Getting started
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
See http://code.google.com/p/corsix-th/wiki/GettingStarted for full details.
Briefly:
1) Ensure that you are using a supported platform (Windows, Linux, OS X)
2) Ensure that you have some Theme Hospital data files.
   The demo data files are available at: http://th.corsix.org/Demo.zip
   Copy / extract the data to a directory of your choice.
3) If you have a source code distribution, compile it.
   See http://code.google.com/p/corsix-th/wiki/HowToCompile for details.
4) Start the game for the first time. You will be asked for the location of
   the Theme Hospital data files. Select the directory you chose in step 2.
5) Go play! If this doesn't go smoothly, then consult:
