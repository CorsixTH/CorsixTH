  next_planned (boolean) If the next earthquake has been planned/generated
  start_month (integer) The month the earthquake warning is triggered (1-12)
  start_day (integer) The day of the month the earthquake warning is triggered (1-31)
  size (integer) The amount of damage the earthquake causes (1-9)
  remaining_damage (integer) The amount of damage this earthquake has yet to inflict (1-9)
  damage_timer (integer) The number of hours until the earthquake next inflicts damage if active (0-16)
  warning_timer (integer) The number of hours left until the real damaging earthquake begins (0-600)
  current_map_earthquake (integer) The number of earthquakes that have happened on this map so far
  disabled (boolean) If earthquakes have been disabled by the cheat menu
