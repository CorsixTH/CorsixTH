This file is used to ensure that the compiled binary being used by Lua is up
to date. Without this system, if the binary was not recent enough, then the
user would get a confusing error message along the lines of attemping to call
a nil value (as new API functions are nil in older binaries).

When a new API call is added to the C++ source, the version number in this
file should be incremented. Traditionally, the version number will be similar
to the SVN revision number. Likewise, if an existing function is changed in a
way incompatible with old Lua code, then the version number needs to change.

Note: This file compiles as both Lua and C++. */
