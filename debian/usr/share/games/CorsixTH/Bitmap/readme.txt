Almost all graphics resources are loaded from the original Theme Hospital data
files, which is why there are only a few files in this directory.

build_room_dialog_close.bmp : this sprite is missing from the game's REQ09V.DAT
map_cell_outline.bmp : there is no nice outline tile in the game's VBLK-0.DAT
flag_*.bmp : used as debug overlays
fullscreen_border_*.bmp : used as borders as 640x480 "fullscreen" backgrounds
bootstrap_font.bmp : a homemade bitmap font which can be used for drawing text
                     before the original data files are loaded.
